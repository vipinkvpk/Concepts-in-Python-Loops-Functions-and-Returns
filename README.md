# Concepts-in-Python-Loops-Functions-and-Returns
By the end of this project, you will create a number of examples that will develop your learning around concepts in Python. This course will enable you to take your beginner knowledge of Python to the next level by incorporating loops, functions, and returns into your programming. Thus, you will be able to develop more complex code and be able to solve more difficult problems. This course will provide students with the knowledge behind different concepts in Python such as loops, methods, and returns which will enable you to write high-quality code.  Thus, ensuring that your code is efficient and robust which is an essential aspect of writing high-quality code. This project will take students through a number of examples demonstrating the most useful Python concepts. You will gain an understanding of these concepts from the in-depth examples provided.
